# Round Reports
 An SCP:SL Exiled plugin which generates reports at the end of each round, and shares them in your Discord server.  
  
This plugin uses [paste.ee](https://paste.ee/) for hosting reports. This service is provided entirely for free. Reports automatically expire after 30 days; however, they can be saved with a simple tool like the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/).  
  
Note: Statistics from users with Do Not Track (DNT) enabled will still be shown, but all personal information relating to them (Username, SteamId, etc) will be hidden.

 ## Commands
 ### pausereport
 Permission: rr.pause  
 Disables reporting for the duration of the round. Automatically unpauses at the start of the next round.

 ### addremark / remark
 Permission: rr.remark  
 Adds a remark to the report. Can be used to specify event rounds & etc.
